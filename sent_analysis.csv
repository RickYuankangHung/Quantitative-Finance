Since then, due to the negative impact of the economic crisis, the price of glyphosate has been leaking all the way. Since 2009, it has been hovering between 20,000 and 25,000 yuan. The main reasons for the stagnant price of glyphosate are: (1) Domestic glyphosate production capacity The surplus is more serious. According to incomplete statistics, the annual production capacity of glyphosate in China has exceeded 1 million tons, and the global demand for glyphosate in 2009 is only about 800,000 tons; (2) the price of oil is between 70-80 dollars, it is difficult to return In 2008, the price of 140 US dollars/barrel was high, and bioenergy was cooled down. (3) The export tax rebate rate was lowered, which affected the export of glyphosate. On July 15 this year, China cancelled the export tax rebate for glyphosate products (the original tax rate was 9%), which increased the export cost of glyphosate products. Since the economic crisis, the demand for international glyphosate has also declined. Domestic glyphosate export enterprises have limited ability to increase export prices and pass costs. Based on the above factors, the operation status of domestic glyphosate enterprises has been deteriorating since the second half of 2008. Although Xin'an has a good resource recycling system, it is still difficult to get rid of the shadow of the decline in profitability. In the first half of this year, the gross profit margin of the company's glyphosate products was only 7.14%, which was 12% lower than the same period of the previous year. The profitability of this product hit a new low in the past four years, which seriously dragged down the company's performance. However, as most domestic glyphosate enterprises have been in a state of loss for nearly one year, it is expected that their prices and gross profit margins will continue to decline in the later period.",-2,0.17,0.07,0.75,0.01,-0.71

The slowdown in revenue growth is mainly limited by the capacity bottleneck. The current production capacity is 5 million m2. In 2013, the production of filter material was 4.49 million m2, and the capacity utilization rate was close to 90%. ? The decline in raw material prices raises gross margin. In the first half of the year, the prices of high performance synthetic chemical fibers (PPS, PTFE, P84) continued to decline. Taking PPS as an example, the price in 2006 was about 121,100 yuan / ton, and in 2009 it was reduced to 80,000 yuan / ton. In August 2014, Alibaba's online price was 55,000 - 60,000 yuan / ton. As the company's raw materials accounted for nearly 90% of operating costs, operating costs fell by 1.76% in the first half of the year, and gross profit margin increased by 4.58 percentage points. ? Investment points: 1 The bottleneck of production capacity of the filter material business is increasingly obvious. In 2013, the company produced 4.49 million cubic meters of filter material, and the capacity utilization rate was close to 90%. In the current single product situation, the release of capacity is decisive for the company's business growth. At present, the company does not have plans to build new capacity. It is expected that the impact of capacity bottlenecks on revenue growth will become more significant after 2014. 2 Business development is still not ideal. The company's transition to a comprehensive environmental protection company has not progressed smoothly. In 2013, both asset restructurings ended in failure. In the first half of the year, it participated in the company's three-dimensional operation, and its role was to stabilize the company's profitability, which made it difficult to make practical implications for the company's strategic transformation. 3 Shareholders' operating differences have increased.

In terms of formula pellets, we believe that the market outlook is still good, especially after the pilot is released, there will be a significant increase.

2015935,0,The year-on-year sharp decline in interim results was mainly due to the sharp fall in the price of chicken products.,"In the first half of the year, affected by the H7N9 avian flu, the domestic chicken meat consumption market was sluggish and the price of chicken meat fell sharply. According to statistics, the average price of white striped chicken in the main producing area in the first quarter was 10.54 yuan / kg, down 16.79%; the average wholesale price of white striped chicken in the main producing area in the second quarter was 10.29 yuan / kg, down 20.47% year on year, down 2.36%. We estimate that the average price of chicken meat sold in the first half of the year was about 9,000 yuan / ton, down 15% year-on-year, close to the cost line. In the first quarter alone, the company realized a net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies of 21.78 million yuan, so it is estimated that the net profit for the second quarter is -1178-900 million yuan. 2, the chicken price is bullish, the company's performance turning point has been. In the second half of the year, the prices of broiler series products will increase, and the market will be bullish. First of all, due to the poor introduction of ancestral broiler breeders, the production capacity of parental chicks is expected to be clear. In the first half of 2017, the introduction of ancestral broiler breeders was only 210,000 sets. In the same period, the ancestral reserve stocks fluctuated downwards, with a year-to-date reduction of more than 40%; the reserve inventory is the leading indicator in the production column, and the reserve inventory change usually lags behind the production column by about 6 months. Therefore, we expect that the ancestral breeders will also fluctuate in the production stocks in the second half of the year. If the reduction and the reduction of the reserve stocks are equivalent, the number of stocks in the stocks will be reduced from the current 820,000 sets to 500,000 sets, which will be significant. Less than 800,000 sets of industry equilibrium levels. Secondly, the parent-generation chicken farms have increased their elimination efforts and rational forced moulting due to the sustained large losses in the previous period, which prompted the production of chicken and broiler to clear out, which is conducive to the increase in the price of chicken and chicken. At present, the broiler industry system experts estimate that the industry's parent-generation broiler breeders are only about 23 million sets in the stock market, the lowest value since 2015, significantly lower than the industry equilibrium value of 3,000-31 million sets. Third, the negative impact of bird flu is weakened, consumer demand is at the bottom, and it is expected to pick up later. We believe that the price increase of this round can be compared with the first half of 16 years. It is estimated that the average price of chicken meat products in the second half of the year will reach 10,000 yuan / ton. The price increase will drive the company's performance to rebound sharply. 3. Downstream acquisitions, the company's industrial chain integration strategy has steadily advanced. On April 13, 2017, the company announced that it plans to issue 124 million shares to acquire 100% equity of Shengnong Food, with a tentative issue price of 16.21 yuan. Currently, the matter is being reviewed by regulatory authorities. Shengong Foods specializes in chicken products, mainly for fast food brands such as KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonald's, as well as commercial channels such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour, and Japanese chain systems to provide cooked food products. With an annual production capacity of 160,000 tons, two plants will be put into operation in the second half of 2017, and the production capacity is expected to increase to 220,000 tons. After the completion of the acquisition, the company's business will be extended from the original white feather broiler breeding and slaughtering to the downstream food processing, forming an agricultural food group with integrated industrial chain. As the profitability of the cooked food processing business is more stable than upstream farming and slaughtering, we believe that the acquisition will help improve the stability of the company's performance. 4. Give an “overweight” rating. Without considering the acquisition, it is estimated that the company's revenue in 17-19 years will be 83.95/91.73/96.74 billion yuan, the net profit will be 4.49/5.35/616 million yuan, and the EPS will be 0.40/0.48/0.55 yuan, corresponding to PE 37/. 31/27 times, giving an “overweight” rating. 5.

Driven by the improvement in gross profit margin, the company's second-quarter loss of -78 million was narrower than the first quarter's -190 million. Although steel prices are still in the doldrums in the second quarter, as our annual strategic point of view, this year's iron ore supply and demand reversed the industrial chain profits from iron ore to smelting, especially since April, iron ore prices have fallen significantly. Stronger than steel prices. The industry's profitability has bottomed out since April, and the rebound in sheet profitability is better than that of building materials. In the first half of the year, the gross profit margin of the company's bar was only 1.98%, while the gross profit margin of the medium-wide tropical was 6.8%. The higher proportion of building materials in the company's product structure leads to limited profit margin improvement. ? In the first half of the year, iron ore profit improvement was difficult to sustain: in the first half of the year, the company's iron ore concentrate production was 600,000 tons, up 15.10% year-on-year, operating income was 534 million yuan, up 6.48% year-on-year; net profit was 74,557,600 yuan, up 24.75% year-on-year.

The year-on-year decline was also lower than the decline of 12.6% year-on-year in the market price. We believe that the internal settlement price of the company may be a long-term agreement price, which has not fully reflected the fluctuation of market prices. At the same time, the performance of domestically produced minerals in the first half of the year was generally stronger than that of imported mines. Since May, there has been a sharp drop in the price of domestic mines. The profit of domestic mines has deteriorated significantly in May and June.

This is in line with the sharp rise in the price of the main raw material, Taizishen, from 2010. In the second half of the year, we began to control the sales of the main product, Jiangzhong Jianwei Xiaoshi Tablets (we expect to contribute more than 80% of the company's OTC business in 2010). The sharp decline in revenue of this business is also the main reason for the company's overall revenue decline in the first half of 2011; 2), ""health products business"" achieved sales revenue of 210 million, an increase of 43.93%; 3), ""pharmaceutical business"" to achieve sales revenue 290 million, an increase of 43.93%.",-2,0,0.34,0.63,0.02,-0.65

The growth rate of the old varieties of four-price brains and micro-cards was lower than expected: the income of the four-price brains reached 63.31 million in the first half of the year, down 19.9%, and the micro-cards were 24.72 million, up 21% year-on-year, lower than expected. Among them, the four-price ECM and the first half of the year implemented a new version of GMP transformation, which affected the batch issuance. The new production has already begun, and the situation will improve in the second half of the year. The income of the agent variety Hib decreased slightly. It is expected that the agent Hib revenue will be 153 million, down 9.16% year-on-year.

590208,1,The decline in the average sales price of the company's products is the main factor in the decline of Q3 performance.,"In terms of output, the company achieved a production of 7.298 million tons of steel in the first half of the year. We expect the company's steel output in the third quarter to be around 3.76 million tons, which is the same as the second quarter. Based on this calculation, the company's price per ton of steel in the third quarter fell by 3.8% (Q2, the average accounting price of Q3 company's tons of materials was 5104 and 49.09 million tons / yuan). The decline in the price of oriented silicon steel has a greater impact on the company's performance. Taking 30Q120 oriented silicon steel as an example, the average price of Q3 in Shanghai is about 18,380 yuan/ton, down 13.3% from the previous month. In the first half of the year, the company's total output of silicon steel was 880,000 tons, of which we expect about 200,000 tons of oriented silicon steel. As the competitive landscape of domestically oriented silicon steel has changed, and the aggressive market strategies of new entrants such as Baosteel and Anshan Iron and Steel, the cost sensitivity of downstream transformer users, and the slowdown in profit growth of the transformer industry, we believe that the price of oriented silicon steel may remain in the long term. The level is around 20,000 yuan / ton. The price of non-oriented silicon steel continued to rise, exceeding market expectations, mainly due to the continued demand from demand, especially from the home appliance industry. The cost has risen slightly. From the perspective of iron ore procurement structure, 70-75% of the company is imported ore, of which Changxie Mine accounts for about 50% of imported ore. Therefore, although the nominal price of Changxie Mine in the third quarter is about 23%, However, considering the inventory factor of the company for about 1.5 months, the long-term procurement structure of Changxie Mine and the inventory adjustment factor have made the company's pressure on the cost impact in the third quarter relatively moderate (compared with about 70% of Maanshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.). ratio). In addition, the company's third-quarter cost control measures reduced management expenses by 0.4 percentage points. According to the production progress in the third quarter, the annual output of 16.05 million tons of steel is difficult to achieve. We expect the company's annual steel output to increase by about 18% year-on-year, which is still the largest increase among the three major steels. Next year, the company's increase will mainly come from hot-rolled CSP and three-cold rolling. The company's cold-rolled sheet is expected to be around 4 million tons this year, and there will still be an increase of 600,000-700,000 tons next year. The company's share placement plan has recently been adjusted: the company's share placement proposal in 2009 is no more than 2,351,445,700 shares, and the raised funds are no more than 12 billion. It is planned to invest in three projects: (1) acquiring the shares held by the group 77.6% equity of Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Echeng Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., 100% equity of Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Powder Metallurgy Co., Ltd., operating assets and liabilities related to metallurgical slag utilization, and scientific assets of scientific research. The project is expected to use raised funds. 628,928.62 million yuan; (2) Acquisition of the pellet production facility project located in Xinmiao Industrial Park, Echeng District, Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Mining Co., Ltd., which is expected to use the raised funds of 1,216,173,400 yuan; (3) supplementary liquidity projects. At the beginning of October, the company announced that the second pellet facility project was not the subject of acquisition, and the allotment funds were also reduced to no more than 10.7 billion yuan. At the same time, the company extended the validity of the rights issue proposal until September 23, 2011, so the allotment time may be postponed. As of 10/28, the company's net assets per share was 3.51 yuan. As of 2010, Egang has a production capacity of 4.4 million tons of crude steel. The main products are rod and wire, cold-rolled sheet and wide and thick plate. The overall asset quality is lower than that of WISCO. After the acquisition, the steel production capacity of Wuhan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. will reach 21 million tons. By then, the company's production capacity will be equivalent to that of Hebei Iron and Steel, second only to Baosteel. In addition, the group company also owns assets such as Kunming Steel, Liugang and Fangchenggang projects, but no plans have been made yet. ?

522142,1,The main reason for the sharp decline in the company's performance in the first quarter was that the increase in cost led to a 8.4% decline in gross profit margin.,"Since the first quarter was the off-season of construction, this year, construction began in mid-March in southern Xinjiang, and construction began in northern Xinjiang in early April. Therefore, even though cement prices increased significantly year-on-year, revenue growth was limited due to limited sales. The rising cost is the main factor in the decline of the company's performance. There are two main reasons: First, due to the two 2500t/d production lines in Kezhou and Bazhou in the first half of last year, the company's fixed assets increased, resulting in increased depreciation; second, coal prices rose. As a result, the company's production costs have increased, so rising costs are the main reason for the decline in gross profit margin. The increase in the three-fee rate is another factor in the decline in performance. In the first quarter, the company's three-rate rate increased from 21.2% in the same period last year to 22.4%, mainly due to the rapid increase in the financial expense ratio. The company currently has a number of cement clinker production line investment construction plans, for the fundraising, the company has increased The strength of borrowing, especially long-term borrowing, increased from 904 million yuan at the beginning of the year to 993 million yuan, which directly led to an increase in financial expenses. Advance receipts increased by 8.7 times quarter-on-quarter and 3.6 times year-on-year, indicating strong demand for cement. In the first quarter, the company's advance receipts increased from RMB 35 million at the beginning of the year to RMB 342 million, an increase of 8.7 times from the previous quarter and a 3.6-fold increase from the previous year's RMB 74 million. A large amount of advance receipts indicates that Xinjiang's cement demand is strong, and downstream customers are either Worried that the cement can not be bought in the peak season, or worried about the rise in cement prices in the peak season, the substantial increase in advance receipts is also in line with our previous judgment on the high cement industry in Xinjiang. In early April, Xinjiang cement prices rose sharply year-on-year, and cement prices are expected to continue to rise in the future. The price of cement in southern Xinjiang has risen by 50 yuan/ton. At present, the prices of Aksu, Kashi and Hetian cement have increased from 380 yuan/ton to 430 yuan/ton in the previous period; the ex-factory price in Urumqi has reached 500 yuan/ton, compared with the same period last year. It is 340 yuan / ton; as the market is only at the beginning of the initial stage, but the cement price has risen significantly, in view of the fact that the shortage of cement in Xinjiang this year still exists, it is expected that cement prices will continue to rise in the future. The investment rating is ""Recommended"". As the price of cement in Xinjiang exceeded our expectations, we increased the EPS of the company for 11-13 years to 1.01, 1.33 and 1.93 yuan.

In addition, the project gross margin decreased by 6.26pct to 18.39%. The decline in revenue and profitability has led to a decline in performance, and the decline in real estate gardens in 2015 is the real reason behind this. Affected by the engineering business, the profitability declined significantly. The operating cash flow needs to be improved. The company's gross profit margin in 2015 was 20.84%, down 5.29pct year-on-year, which was mainly dragged down by the garden engineering business. The net profit margin was 8.19%, down 4.39pct year-on-year. This is mainly due to the intensified competition in the gardening industry and the sluggish real estate industry. The gross profit margin of some new contracted projects has declined. The period expense rate was 9.22%, an increase of 1.59pct. The sales expense ratio increased from 0 to 0.13%, mainly due to the sales expenses incurred by the deep blue environmental protection.

The company's net operating cash in 2015 was -401 million yuan, which was worse than the -1.667 billion in 2014. The main reason is that the real estate control policy continued, and the overall capital recovery of the garden construction industry was affected. With the vigorous implementation of the PPP model, the company's operating cash position is expected to improve in the future. Real estate recovery led to steady growth of the main business of the garden.

The SCFI spot in October-December 2013 The market freight index fell to a minimum of $1,731/FEU, $1,718/FEU, and $1,700/FEU, respectively, which is equivalent to the freight rate in January-February 2012.

At the company level, the large ship of 18,900 TEUs to be delivered by the end of 2014 will also increase the scale effect of the company's operations. From the perspective of the shipping industry as a whole, we have been optimistic that the capacity utilization rate of the shipping industry will bottom out in 2014, and shipping companies will transition from a cash point to a breakeven point.
